# Tools For King's Field IV
These tools will let you extract and convert files from the PS2 FromSoftware game King's Field IV (The Ancient City)

Confirmed to work with European (SLES-50920), US (SLUS-20318, SLUS-20353) and Japanese (SLPS-25057) release. Unknown if they work on the version included with the Dark Side Box collection.

Also included is a single (very, very experimental) tool for the STZ archive on the Shadow Tower Abyss disc.

### Compiling
The project files are for MSVS 2019, NET Framework 4.7.2. Load 'em into Visual Studio and away you go.

### Format Definitions / Overview
[On the wiki](https://github.com/TheStolenBattenberg/ToolsForKFIV/wiki).

You'll find detailed descriptions and c style documentation for the file formats on the wiki section of the repository, that can be used to implement these file formats in your own projects. The documentation is updated a lot more frequently than the code is as I'm constantly putting new findings down there.
