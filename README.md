### Format Definitions
You'll find detailed descriptions and C style documentation for the file formats [on the wiki](https://github.com/TheStolenBattenberg/ToolsForKFIV/wiki) section of the repository, that can be used to implement these file formats in your own projects. Fair warning, wiki info tends to lag behind a lot and the latest findings will always be found in the source code only.
