# Tools For King's Field IV
These tools will let you extract and convert files from the PS2 FromSoftware game King's Field IV (The Ancient City)

Confirmed to work with European (SLES-50920) and US (SLUS-20318, SLUS-20353) versions of the game but it is unknown if they work with the Japanese (SLPS-25057) release or the Dark Side Box version, the text extractor will for sure not work with either.

### Compiling
The project files are for MSVS 2019, NET Framework 4.7.2. Load 'em into Visual Studio and away you go. If you're knowledgable enough to do something else, then you should know not me.
